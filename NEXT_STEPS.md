# Next Steps

**What I did today:**
- Integrated React frontend with Flask backend.
- Confirmed `http://localhost:5173` UI can talk to `http://localhost:5000/chat`.

**What to do tomorrow:**
1. Run `python app.py` in `backend` to start server.
2. Run `npm run dev` in `frontend` to start React app.
3. Test a few more queries from the UI.
4. Consider adding loading states or error messages.
5. Plan deployment steps (requirements.txt, Procfile, choose hosting service).

**Useful Commands:**
```bash
# Start backend
cd backend
source venv/Scripts/activate
python app.py

# Start frontend
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
